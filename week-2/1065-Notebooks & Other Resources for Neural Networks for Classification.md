# Notebooks & Other Resources for Neural Networks for Classification

* Notebook on Neural Networks for Classification (in this notebook, we will building a neural network to recognize a correct digit in a given image): [https://dphi.tech/notebooks/845/gunnika/mnist-for-multi-class-classification?](https://dphi.tech/notebooks/845/gunnika/mnist-for-multi-class-classification?)
