Your final marks in the bootcamp will depend on three factors:

1. Quiz Marks - your performance in the two quizzes will decide 15 marks. Each quiz question is worth one mark.
2. Final Project - 70 marks will be decided by the peer review of your final project. Peer review will begin after the project deadline is over. You will receive an email regarding peer review.
3. Peer Review - reviewing the notebooks assigned to you will carry the remaining 15 marks. It is mandatory to complete the peer review to earn the certificate. Once again, peer review will begin after the bootcamp ends.

You must score an **overall 60%** to get the certificate in this bootcamp.
