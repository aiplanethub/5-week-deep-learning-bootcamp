This week, you will work on a Deep Learning Hands-On problem for Image Classification. You can find all the details on the next page.

Remember, submitting your notebook for the Challenge is mandatory for earning a certificate. Your notebook will be reviewed by other learners in the bootcamp, so add comments to explain any complicated code. 

Reminder: you will receive an email regarding peer review after the bootcamp is over. Please ensure you grade the notebooks you receive; it is an essential part of the bootcamp.

Good luck!
